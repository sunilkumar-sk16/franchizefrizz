        <h3 class="fst-italic strong">Jack Sparrow</h3>
        <p class="fst-italic strong">
          Jack Sparrow was a legendary pirate of the Seven Seas, and the irreverent trickster of the Caribbean. <br>
          A captain of equally dubious morality and sobriety, a master of self-promotion and self-interest, Jack fought a constant and losing battle with his own best tendencies.<br>
          As a young pirate he earned the name Jack Sparrow when he trapped the notorious Spanish pirate hunter Capit√°n Salazar in the Devil's Triangle.<br>
          Over the course of time, Captain Jack Sparrow became a center of intrigue as myths and legends have been told of his exploits.
          Jack Sparrow relied more on intelligence, agility, and quick wit to protect himself, rather than physical strength.
